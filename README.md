# BigDecimal-and-Complex-Numbers-in-C
Implementation of BigDecimal and Complex numbers in C using only basic arrays

The main idea behind this project was to not use any data structures except for single- dimensional arrays
With use of these classes you can do basic arithmetical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) regardless of their size.

The whole project also implements same operations on Complex Numbers. I have also started implementing custom list class MyList that enables users to store and manipulate multiple BigDecimals

Some parts can be simplified (especially the adding function is way too complicated) and I will probably do so in the future but for now it works just fine, I compiled these files using gcc in order to check for the potential memory leaks and discovered none.
